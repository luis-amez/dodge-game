# Dodge!

Scream your way out to the end!

You can try it [here](https://luis-amez.github.io/dodge-game/).

**Instructions:**

Say "left" or "right" to move your player. You can give multiple instructions together, i.e.: "left left left". The speed is incremented when the same instruction is given more than once. Make a pause after giving any set of instructions to apply them.

**Only works in Chrome.**
